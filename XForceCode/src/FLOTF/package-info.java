/**
 * This project, by NSIN X-Force interns Bernard Chan and Sonali Loomba, is centered around streamlining
 * aircraft maintenance for Travis Air Force Base. Presently, the first steps of the maintenance process begin with
 * identifying the malfunctioning part on the flight line, and subsequently putting in an order for that part.
 * The current method of ordering a part uses a multitude of platforms and requires inquiry requests to different
 * departments before a formal supply order can be submitted. This process can be unwieldy and there is room for
 * improvement to make it more efficient. Our goal is to automate this complicated process to make it faster and
 * easier for maintenance professionals to order new parts. We are using Java to build the desktop application with
 * JavaFX as the GUI framework. We also used the PDFBox and JSoup Java libraries to parse and scrape information about the parts.
